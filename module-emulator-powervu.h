/*
 * This function searches for EMM keys and sends their Unique Address (UA) back to NCam as
 * EMM filter. The EMM keys are picked from all group id's that have ECM keys for the srvid
 * specified as input. If there is a large ammount of EMM keys for a given group, only the
 * first "maxCount" UA's are sent as EMM filters. The rest are not used at all.
 *
 * In the rare case where two or more EMM keys with the same UA belong to different groups,
 * and these groups also have ECM keys for the srvid in request, there is a chance the ECM
 * keys in the "wrong" group to be updated. This is because the EMM algorithm has no way of
 * knowing in which group the service id belongs to. A workaround for this designing flaw
 * is to make sure there are no EMM keys with the same UA between different groups.
 *
 * Hexserials must be of type "uint8_t hexserials[maxCount][4]". If srvid is equal to 0xFFFF
 * all serials are returned (no service id filtering is done). Return value is 0 on error,
 * 1 on success.
